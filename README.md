# cellfate

## Brief Background: 

Stem cells can become different types of cells in our bodies. Although all cells in a body would have the same DNA, there are proteins called transcription factors that can regulate gene expressions and control the development of cell types. We are interested in confirming the factors that can affect the cell development, i.e. their fates. In our model, the factors of cell density and cell types of the neigbors are concerned. 

The experimental images of cell clusters are processed by a black-box cell counting software to identify the cell number, identity and location at different time points. Then we are going to fit the model of differential equation shown in the jypter notebook, model.ipynb, using the code of this package.
