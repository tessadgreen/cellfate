    "- errors due to cell counting algorithm (stochasticity from the observation)\n",
    "    - To process our data set, we use a black-box cell counting software from MIT's Broad Institute. While this software is very good, it is still not perfect (and is also not as good as the naked eye). It will make errors due to issues such as image quality and resolution (blurring cell outlines), a wide spread of cell sizes (this type of segmentation algorithm usually does better when cells are relatively uniform in size), and possible overlap between cells. Because this is a mixture of many types of uncertainties, each of which has an unknown distribution. A gaussian is the most conservative way of estimating error, so we will treat these errors as gaussian with a single, non-time-varying $\\sigma$ and mean 0. To determine the value of $\\sigma_{obs}$ we will manually count the cells in a small subset of our images, then compare our counts against the actual count to determine the error of the computer algorithm. \n",

    "- stochasticity of cell behavior\n",
    "    - In this particular case, researchers have observed that the Sox2 reporter is unstable--some cells will silence their fluorescently tagged Sox2 while maintaining their untagged copy.  We expect this $k_{silence}$ to be significantly smaller than the other values, but we should nonetheless include it. However, it is not clear what would be the distribution of uncertainties originated from this Poisson loss process of cell reporters. Including this uncertainties, the model will present statistical noise, and to be mostly conservative, we may assume the uncertainty to be Gaussian with variance $\\sigma_{cells}^2$. The estimation of this variance requires further discussion.\n",
